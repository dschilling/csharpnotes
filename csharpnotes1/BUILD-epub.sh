# THIS SCRIPT BUILDS JAVANOTES AS AN EPUB EBOOK.
# IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED (PERMANENTLY) EXPERIMENTAL.

# The script can convert the .epub file to a .mobi file
# if an appropriate utilty is available and you uncomment
# and edit one of the following lines.  The first uses
# an old utility named kindlegen from amazon.com that is no 
# longer available for download.  The second uses a command
# that is installed on Linux as part of the Calibre ebook
# viewer.

# KINDLEGEN='/home/eck-mint13/KindleGen/kindlegen'
# EBOOKCONVERT='/usr/bin/ebook-convert'

# VARIABLES USED IN THIS SCRIPT CAN BE SET IN BUILT-env.sh; see that file
# for more information.
